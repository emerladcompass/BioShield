# Contributing to BioShield

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to **BioShield** 🛡️🌱  
This project aims to build an intelligent, modular, and production-ready platform for soil monitoring, auto-adjustment, and AI-driven agricultural analytics.

We welcome contributions from researchers, developers, engineers, and domain experts.

## 📌 Project Philosophy

BioShield is built on the following principles:

- **Scientific rigor** – Clear logic, reproducible behavior, and documented design
- **Modularity** – Each component should be independent and replaceable
- **Clean architecture** – No hidden dependencies, no magic imports
- **Production readiness** – Code must be stable, readable, and testable
- **Research friendliness** – Easy to extend for experiments and publications

🧪 Code Standards

Please follow these rules:

Python 3.8+ compatible

Clear, readable variable and function names

No hard-coded paths

No global state abuse

No circular imports

Docstrings for all public classes and functions

English language only in code and comments



---

🧠 Architectural Rules (Important)

No direct coupling between modules unless justified

Core engine must remain framework-agnostic

AI modules must be optional and pluggable

Avoid monolithic designs

Prefer composition over inheritance
